# pairwatch
PairWatch lets friends watch a local video in sync—directly in the browser—without uploading to a server. Media flows peer-to-peer over WebRTC; a tiny signaling service and TURN relay exist only to help peers connect through NATs. Sync is driven by a Leader/Follower model using the leader’s media clock as the single source of truth.
